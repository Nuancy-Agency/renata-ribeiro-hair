## Development

When starting the dev server, use background mode:

```
astro dev --background
```

Manage the background server with `astro dev stop`, `astro dev status`, and `astro dev logs`.

## Hardening: never let JS-only rules hide real content

`.reveal` (scroll-in effect) and any Alpine `x-cloak`-gated element (mobile nav, floating WhatsApp CTA) must never be the *only* thing standing between the visitor and real content/CTAs. If the script fails (CSP, ad-blocker, slow/broken network, JS disabled), that content must still be reachable.

- `Layout.astro`'s `<head>` already ships a `<noscript>` block forcing `.reveal` to `opacity:1`, hiding the JS-only toggle button (`data-js-toggle`), and force-opening the mobile nav (`#menu-mobile[x-cloak]`). Keep it in sync: any new `x-cloak`-gated nav/CTA panel needs its `id` added to that block's selectors.
- When adding a new reveal/menu/floating-CTA pattern, either make it visible-by-default with JS only adding the transition class, or extend the existing `<noscript>` block — from the first version, not as a later fix.
- Found 2026-09-16 via `/impeccable harden`: this exact bug existed in all 5 Nuance Agency sites (shared site-forge template). This site was the visual reference used to fix the others' Hero framing, but shared the same JS-hiding bug. Logged in Obsidian `Atualizações.md` → "Checklist Técnico (Todos os Sites)".
